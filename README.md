# Project Gallery

A small project, of a photo gallery, made with webpack, bootstrap and using ajax requests to inject the HTML.

To run it just clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jhonatavbrg/project-gallery.git
```
And then double click on the "index.html" file or run it via http-server, live-server...
